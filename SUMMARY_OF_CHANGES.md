## Next Steps for the User

1. **Read**: Start with `START_HERE_LOCAL_CPU.md`
2. **Run**: Execute `bash scripts/local_cpu_train.sh`
3. **Learn**: Follow documentation during training
4. **Analyze**: Use `LOCAL_CPU_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md` after training
5. **Compare**: Read `TRAINING_COMPARISON.md`
6. **Scale**: Move to GPU training when ready

## Prerequisites and Setup

Before running the training script:

1. **Python 3.10 or higher**:
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.10+
   ```

2. **Rust/Cargo (latest nightly)**:
   ```bash
   rustup update
   rustc --version  # Should be 1.93.0-nightly or newer (October 2025+)
   cargo --version  # Should be 1.93.0-nightly or newer
   ```

   **Important**: The nanochat repo requires Rust edition2024, which is only available in recent nightly builds (October 2025 or newer). If you have an older version, run `rustup update`.

3. **Sufficient disk space**:
   ```bash
   df -h ~
   # Need ~2GB free
   ```

4. **Internet connection**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://www.google.com
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: `uv: command not found`

**Problem**: The `uv` package manager installs to `~/.local/bin` which may not be in your PATH.

**Solution**: The script has been updated to automatically add `~/.local/bin` to PATH. If you still encounter this:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
bash scripts/local_cpu_train.sh
```

### Issue 2: Rust `edition2024` Error

**Problem**: Older versions of Rust/Cargo (before October 2025) don't support edition2024.

**Error message**:
```
feature `edition2024` is required
The package requires the Cargo feature called `edition2024`, but that feature is not stabilized in this version of Cargo
```

**Solution**: Update Rust to the latest nightly:
```bash
rustup update
rustc --version  # Verify 1.93.0-nightly or newer
cargo --version  # Verify 1.93.0-nightly or newer
bash scripts/local_cpu_train.sh
```

**Note**: This is the most common issue when first running the script.

## Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when:

‚úÖ Script runs without immediate errors
‚úÖ Data downloads successfully
‚úÖ Tokenizer trains and saves
‚úÖ Base model trains and checkpoints
‚úÖ Midtraining completes
‚úÖ SFT completes
‚úÖ Report.md is generated
‚úÖ You can chat with the model

## Educational Value

This setup provides:

1. **Hands-on experience** with all training phases
2. **Understanding** of the complete pipeline
3. **Code familiarity** through guided analysis
4. **Foundation** for GPU/HPC training
5. **Debugging skills** with local execution
6. **Parameter intuition** through experimentation

## Conclusion

This local CPU training setup provides a complete, non-invasive, well-documented way to learn the nanochat training pipeline without requiring GPU access or modifying existing workflows. It's designed specifically for educational purposes and achieving deep understanding of the codebase.

The user can now:
- ‚úÖ Run complete training locally
- ‚úÖ Understand all training phases
- ‚úÖ Analyze the codebase effectively
- ‚úÖ Scale to production when ready
- ‚úÖ Use Ptolemy HPC with confidence

All while keeping existing GPU and HPC workflows completely intact.
