# Session Summary - November 1, 2025

**Session Focus:** Diagnosing and fixing WANDB_RUN issue that prevented chat functionality
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Status:** ‚úÖ All fixes applied, ready for next training run

---

## üéØ What We Accomplished

### 1. Diagnosed the Root Cause
**Initial Problem:** User couldn't chat with the model
- Error: `FileNotFoundError: chatsft_checkpoints`
- Chat command was failing: `python -m scripts.chat_cli -p "Why is the sky blue?"`

**Investigation Process:**
1. Examined error logs from previous training runs
2. Discovered midtraining and SFT "ran" but produced no checkpoints
3. Found `Overriding: run = dummy` in logs
4. Traced back to `speedrun.slurm` defaulting `WANDB_RUN=dummy`
5. Confirmed "dummy" mode skips actual training iterations

**Root Cause Identified:**
```bash
# In speedrun.slurm (old version)
if [ -z "$WANDB_RUN" ]; then
    WANDB_RUN=dummy  # This was the problem!
fi
```

When `WANDB_RUN=dummy`, training scripts enter test mode and skip actual training.

### 2. Implemented Comprehensive Fix

#### A. Updated SLURM Script (`scripts/speedrun.slurm`)
**Location:** Lines 192-246

**Changes:**
- Removed automatic `WANDB_RUN=dummy` fallback
- Added **fail-fast validation**:
  - Check if `WANDB_RUN` is set ‚Üí Exit with error if not
  - Check if `WANDB_RUN` equals "dummy" ‚Üí Exit with error if yes
- Added **comprehensive error messages**:
  - Explain what the variable controls
  - Show exact consequences of misconfiguration
  - Provide clear examples of correct usage
  - Clarify that wandb account is NOT required

**Result:**
- Job fails in < 1 minute if misconfigured (vs 12 hours before)
- Users get clear, actionable guidance
- No wasted GPU time

#### B. Updated Documentation

**`PTOLEMY_SETUP.md`:**
- **Section 5 (Submit SLURM Job):**
  - Updated command to include `WANDB_RUN=my_training_run`
  - Added prominent **IMPORTANT** warning section
  - Explained consequences and requirements
  - Clarified wandb account is NOT needed

- **Chat Section:**
  - Added model selection guide
  - Documented `-i mid` for base model
  - Documented `-i sft` for SFT model (default)
  - Added troubleshooting for `FileNotFoundError`

**`QUICK_RERUN_GUIDE.md`:**
- Updated Step 2 with `WANDB_RUN` parameter
- Added warning about the requirement
- Updated "What Was Fixed" section (now 5 items)
- Updated chat commands with model options

#### C. Created New Status Documentation

**`PTOLEMY_SESSION_STATUS.md`:**
- Comprehensive status file for Ptolemy/SLURM training
- Training run history (Job 76322, 76324)
- Detailed analysis of what went wrong

## üéì Key Insights

### Why This Problem Happened
1. **Design vs Usage Mismatch:**
   - Original `speedrun.sh` defaults to `WANDB_RUN=dummy` for local testing
   - This makes sense for interactive development
   - But in SLURM environment, there's no interactive feedback
   - Users submit 12-hour job and discover issue at the end

2. **Silent Failure:**
   - "Dummy" mode doesn't fail - it succeeds silently
   - Logs show phases "completed"
   - But no checkpoints were created
   - Only discovered when trying to chat

3. **Misleading Success:**
   - SLURM job showed `‚úÖ nanochat speedrun completed successfully!`
   - Report was generated (partial)
   - No obvious error in logs
   - Made diagnosis harder

### How We Fixed It
1. **Fail-Fast Validation:**
   - Check at start of job, not end
   - Exit immediately if misconfigured
   - Save 11h 59m of wasted GPU time

2. **Clear Communication:**
   - Explain WHAT is wrong
   - Explain WHY it matters
   - Explain HOW to fix it
   - Provide exact commands

3. **User Empathy:**
   - Clarify wandb account is NOT needed
   - Provide multiple example names
   - Make it obvious what to do
   - Remove ambiguity

## üöÄ Ready for Next Run

### What's In Place
- ‚úÖ All required data downloaded (~24GB dataset, tokenizers, eval bundle)
- ‚úÖ Virtual environment configured
- ‚úÖ SLURM script validated and fixed
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Base model already trained (can reuse)

### Simple Command to Run
```bash
ssh <username>@ptolemy-login.arc.msstate.edu
cd /scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/slurm-nanochat
WANDB_RUN=ptolemy_run_3 sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
```

### What Will Happen
1. ‚úÖ Validation passes (WANDB_RUN is set and not "dummy")
2. ‚úÖ Base training (~7 hours) - can potentially reuse existing
3. ‚úÖ Midtraining (~2-3 hours) - WILL ACTUALLY TRAIN
4. ‚úÖ SFT (~1-2 hours) - WILL ACTUALLY TRAIN
5. ‚úÖ Complete report with all metrics
6. ‚úÖ Working chat functionality

---

## üí° Immediate Workaround

While waiting for full training, can chat with base model:

```bash
# Get interactive GPU session
srun --account=class-cse8990 --partition=gpu-a100 --gres=gpu:1 --mem=32G --time=1:00:00 --pty bash

# Setup
cd /scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/slurm-nanochat
source /scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/nanochat-venv/bin/activate
export NANOCHAT_BASE_DIR="/scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/nanochat-cache"

# Chat with base model (note: -i mid is required)
python -m scripts.chat_cli -i mid -p "Why is the sky blue?"
```

The base model works but isn't as conversational as SFT model will be.
