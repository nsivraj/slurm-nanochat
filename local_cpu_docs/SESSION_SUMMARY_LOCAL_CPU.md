# Local CPU Training - Session Summary

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Complete Local CPU Training Setup

Successfully created a full local CPU training system with 8 documentation files and 1 training script:

#### Training Script
- **`scripts/local_cpu_train.sh`** (12KB) - Complete automated training pipeline

#### Documentation Files (8 total, ~73KB)
1. **`START_HERE_LOCAL_CPU.md`** (7.0KB) - Entry point and overview
2. **`LOCAL_CPU_QUICKSTART.md`** (5.8KB) - Quick reference guide
3. **`LOCAL_CPU_TRAINING.md`** (9.9KB) - Comprehensive training guide
4. **`LOCAL_CPU_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md`** (12KB) - Code analysis walkthrough
5. **`LOCAL_CPU_README.md`** (10KB) - Complete overview and index
6. **`TRAINING_COMPARISON.md`** (13KB) - CPU vs GPU vs HPC comparison
7. **`SUMMARY_OF_CHANGES.md`** (8.7KB) - What was created and why
8. **`TROUBLESHOOTING_LOCAL_CPU.md`** (6.2KB) - Common issues and solutions

### 2. Fixed Critical Issues

#### Issue #1: `uv: command not found`
- **Problem**: `uv` installs to `~/.local/bin` which wasn't in PATH
- **Fix**: Updated script to automatically add `~/.local/bin` to PATH
- **Location**: `scripts/local_cpu_train.sh` lines 60-74

#### Issue #2: Rust `edition2024` Error
- **Problem**: Rust version was too old (1.82.0-nightly from August 2024)
- **Fix**: Updated Rust to 1.93.0-nightly (October 2025)
- **Command**: `rustup update`
- **Why**: nanochat requires Rust edition2024 (only in recent nightlies)

### 3. Completed Full Training Run

✅ **Training completed successfully!**

All phases executed:
1. ✅ Tokenizer training and evaluation
2. ✅ Base model pretraining
3. ✅ Midtraining (conversation format)
4. ✅ Supervised finetuning
5. ✅ Report generation

**Training artifacts saved to**: `~/.cache/nanochat/`

## Current State

### What Works
- ✅ Complete training pipeline runs end-to-end
- ✅ All documentation updated with troubleshooting
- ✅ Trained model ready to use
- ✅ Training report generated (`report.md`)
- ✅ Virtual environment set up (`.venv/`)

### Environment Setup
```bash
Python: 3.10.19 (in .venv)

Cargo: 1.93.0-nightly (6c1b61003 2025-10-28)
uv: 0.9.7
PATH: Includes ~/.local/bin for uv
```

├── .venv/                  # Python virtual environment
├── report.md               # Training report (copy)
└── rustbpe/target/         # Compiled Rust tokenizer
```

## How to Resume Work

### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /Users/norman.jarvis/forge/work/code/coderockit/msu-phd/slurm-nanochat

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Chat with your trained model
python -m scripts.chat_cli
```

### Next Activities

#### Option 1: Interact with Your Model
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate

# CLI chat
python -m scripts.chat_cli -p "Your question here"

# Interactive mode
python -m scripts.chat_cli

# Web interface
python -m scripts.chat_web
# Open: http://localhost:8000
```

#### Option 2: Analyze the Code
Follow **`LOCAL_CPU_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md`** to understand:
- Training scripts step-by-step
- Transformer architecture
- Data loading and tokenization
- Evaluation benchmarks

#### Option 3: Review Training Results
```bash
# Read the training report
cat report.md

# Check model artifacts
ls -lh ~/.cache/nanochat/models/

# Review training data
ls -lh ~/.cache/nanochat/base_data/
```

#### Option 4: Experiment Further
```bash
# Modify training parameters in the script
nano scripts/local_cpu_train.sh

# Try different model depths, iterations, etc.
# Then re-run training
bash scripts/local_cpu_train.sh
```

#### Option 5: Scale to Production
- **GPU Training**: `bash speedrun.sh` (on cloud with 8xH100)
- **HPC Training**: `sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm` (on Ptolemy)
- See **`TRAINING_COMPARISON.md`** for details

## Important Files to Reference

### To Get Started Again
1. **`START_HERE_LOCAL_CPU.md`** - Quick overview
2. **`SESSION_SUMMARY_LOCAL_CPU.md`** - This file (current state)

### For Using the Model
3. **`LOCAL_CPU_QUICKSTART.md`** - Quick commands
4. **`report.md`** - Your training results

### For Understanding the Code
5. **`LOCAL_CPU_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md`** - Code walkthrough
6. **`LOCAL_CPU_TRAINING.md`** - Training details

### For Troubleshooting
7. **`TROUBLESHOOTING_LOCAL_CPU.md`** - Common issues
8. **`LOCAL_CPU_TRAINING.md`** - Troubleshooting section

### For Comparison
9. **`TRAINING_COMPARISON.md`** - CPU vs GPU vs HPC

## Key Commands Reference

### Environment
```bash
# Activate Python environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Check versions
python --version
rustc --version
uv --version
```

### Training
```bash
# Run full training (takes 1-3 hours)
bash scripts/local_cpu_train.sh

# Clean and re-run (removes .venv)
rm -rf .venv
bash scripts/local_cpu_train.sh
```

### Model Interaction
```bash
# CLI single prompt
python -m scripts.chat_cli -p "Your question"

# CLI interactive
python -m scripts.chat_cli

# Web UI
python -m scripts.chat_web
```

### Analysis
```bash
# View training report
cat report.md

# List model files
ls -lh ~/.cache/nanochat/models/

# Check tokenizer
ls -lh ~/.cache/nanochat/tokenizer/
```

## What NOT to Modify

These files should remain **unchanged** (they're for GPU/HPC):
- ❌ `speedrun.sh` - Production GPU training
- ❌ `scripts/speedrun.slurm` - Ptolemy HPC training
- ❌ `PTOLEMY_SETUP.md` - HPC documentation
- ❌ Any Python files in `scripts/` or `nanochat/`

## Notes for Future Sessions

### If Starting Fresh
```bash
# Just run the training script again
bash scripts/local_cpu_train.sh
# It will skip already-downloaded data
```

### If Errors Occur
1. Check **`TROUBLESHOOTING_LOCAL_CPU.md`** first
2. Most common fix: `rustup update`
3. Second most common: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`

### If You Want to Re-train
```bash
# Remove old virtual environment
rm -rf .venv

# Optionally remove cached data to start completely fresh
rm -rf ~/.cache/nanochat

# Run training
bash scripts/local_cpu_train.sh
```
