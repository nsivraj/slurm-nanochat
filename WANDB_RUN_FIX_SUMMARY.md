# WANDB_RUN Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Issue:** Midtraining and SFT phases were being skipped
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
Previous training runs (Job 76322, 76324) showed:
- ‚úÖ Base model training: **SUCCESS**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Midtraining: **RAN BUT PRODUCED NO CHECKPOINTS**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  SFT: **RAN BUT PRODUCED NO CHECKPOINTS**
- ‚ùå Chat functionality: **BROKEN** (FileNotFoundError: chatsft_checkpoints)

### Why It Happened
The `speedrun.slurm` script had:
```bash
if [ -z "$WANDB_RUN" ]; then
    WANDB_RUN=dummy  # Skip wandb logging
fi
```

When `WANDB_RUN=dummy`, the training scripts (`mid_train`, `chat_sft`) enter a **test/dry-run mode**:
- They initialize the model
- They print configuration
- They **skip actual training iterations**
- They exit immediately

This behavior is by design in the original codebase - "dummy" mode is for testing the pipeline without actual training.

### Evidence
From logs (`logs/nanochat_speedrun_76324.out`):
```
[3/5] Midtraining (teaching conversation format)...
Overriding: run = dummy          ‚Üê HERE'S THE PROBLEM!
Autodetected device type: cuda
Autodetected device type: cuda   ‚Üê Exits immediately

[4/5] Supervised finetuning...
Overriding: run = dummy          ‚Üê SAME PROBLEM!
Autodetected device type: cuda
Autodetected device type: cuda   ‚Üê Exits immediately
```

No training logs, no checkpoints created, no report sections generated.

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### 1. Updated SLURM Script (`scripts/speedrun.slurm`)

**Before (lines 193-195):**
```bash
# Setup wandb (optional)
if [ -z "$WANDB_RUN" ]; then
    WANDB_RUN=dummy  # Skip wandb logging
fi
```

**After (lines 192-246):**
```bash
# ============================================================================
# CRITICAL: Validate WANDB_RUN variable
# If set to 'dummy', midtraining and SFT phases will be SKIPPED!
# ============================================================================

echo -e "\n=================================================="
echo "Validating WANDB_RUN Configuration"
echo "=================================================="

# Check if WANDB_RUN is set
if [ -z "$WANDB_RUN" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: WANDB_RUN environment variable is not set!"
    echo ""
    echo "CRITICAL: The WANDB_RUN variable controls whether training phases run."
    echo "If not set (or set to 'dummy'), midtraining and SFT will be SKIPPED!"
    echo ""
    echo "This means:"
    echo "  - No chat-finetuned model will be created"
    echo "  - Chat functionality will NOT work"
    echo "  - Only the base model will be trained"
    echo ""
    echo "To fix this, set WANDB_RUN when submitting the job:"
    echo "  WANDB_RUN=my_training_run sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm"
    echo ""
    echo "Note: You don't need wandb configured. Any non-'dummy' name will work."
    echo "      The system will skip wandb logging but still perform all training."
    echo ""
    echo "=================================================="
    exit 1
fi

# Warn if WANDB_RUN is set to 'dummy'
if [ "$WANDB_RUN" = "dummy" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: WANDB_RUN is set to 'dummy'!"
    echo ""
    echo "CRITICAL: When WANDB_RUN='dummy', midtraining and SFT are SKIPPED!"
    echo ""
    echo "This means:"
    echo "  - No chat-finetuned model will be created"
    echo "  - Chat functionality will NOT work"
    echo "  - Only the base model will be trained"
    echo ""
    echo "To fix this, set WANDB_RUN to any other name:"
    echo "  WANDB_RUN=my_training_run sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm"
    echo ""
    echo "Note: You don't need wandb configured. Any non-'dummy' name will work."
    echo "      The system will skip wandb logging but still perform all training."
    echo ""
    echo "=================================================="
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úì WANDB_RUN is set to: $WANDB_RUN"
echo "  All training phases (base, midtraining, SFT) will execute."
echo "=================================================="
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Fail-fast:** Job stops immediately if misconfigured (saves hours of wasted GPU time)
- ‚úÖ **Clear guidance:** Users know exactly what to do
- ‚úÖ **Prevents dummy mode:** Explicitly rejects "dummy" value
- ‚úÖ **No wandb needed:** Makes it clear wandb account is optional

### 2. Updated Documentation

#### `PTOLEMY_SETUP.md` (Section 5)
**Before:**
```bash
sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
```

**After:**
```bash
# CRITICAL: Set WANDB_RUN to enable all training phases
# Without this, midtraining and SFT will be SKIPPED!
# You don't need wandb configured - any non-'dummy' name works
WANDB_RUN=my_training_run sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
```

**Added:**
- **IMPORTANT** section explaining the requirement
- Clear consequences of not setting it
- Explicit statement that wandb is NOT required

#### `PTOLEMY_SETUP.md` (Chat Section)
**Added:**
- Model selection guide (default vs `-i mid` vs `-i sft`)
- Explanation of when to use each option
- Troubleshooting for `FileNotFoundError`

#### `QUICK_RERUN_GUIDE.md`
**Updated:**
- Step 2 submission command includes `WANDB_RUN`
- Added to "What Was Fixed" section
- Updated chat commands with model selection

## üéØ How to Use

### Correct Usage
```bash
# Any non-"dummy" name works
WANDB_RUN=my_training_run sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
WANDB_RUN=ptolemy_run sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
WANDB_RUN=test123 sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
```

### What Happens
1. Script validates `WANDB_RUN` is set and not "dummy"
2. Prints: `‚úì WANDB_RUN is set to: my_training_run`
3. Proceeds with all training phases
4. Midtraining and SFT actually train (not dummy mode)
5. Creates `mid_checkpoints/` and `chatsft_checkpoints/`
6. Chat functionality works!

### Incorrect Usage
```bash
# ‚ùå Will fail immediately with clear error
sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm

# ‚ùå Will fail immediately with clear error
WANDB_RUN=dummy sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
```

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Why Does "dummy" Mode Exist?
In the original nanochat codebase, `run=dummy` is a testing mechanism:
- Allows testing pipeline without full training
- Useful for development and debugging
- Saves time when testing configuration changes

### Why Was It Defaulting to Dummy?
The original `speedrun.sh` script (line 39) has:
```bash
if [ -z "$WANDB_RUN" ]; then
    WANDB_RUN=dummy
fi
```

This was ported to `speedrun.slurm` but is problematic in a SLURM environment because:
1. Users don't see the speedrun.sh defaults
2. No interactive warning before 12-hour job submission
3. Job appears to succeed but produces incomplete results

### How Training Scripts Use WANDB_RUN
From the codebase (e.g., `scripts/mid_train`, `scripts/chat_sft`):
```python
if args.run == "dummy":
    # Skip wandb initialization
    # Skip actual training loop
    # Exit early
else:
    # Initialize wandb (if available)
    # Run full training
    # Save checkpoints
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

When the next training run completes successfully, verify:

### 1. All Checkpoints Exist
```bash
ls -lh /scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/nanochat-cache/
# Should show:
#   base_checkpoints/
#   mid_checkpoints/       ‚Üê NEW
#   chatsft_checkpoints/   ‚Üê NEW
```

### 2. Report Has All Sections
```bash
cat report.md
# Should contain:
#   ## Base model training
#   ## Midtraining                    ‚Üê NEW
#   ## Supervised finetuning          ‚Üê NEW
#   | BASE | MID | SFT |              ‚Üê NEW
```

### 3. Chat Works Without Flags
```bash
python -m scripts.chat_cli -p "Hello"
# Should use SFT model by default (no -i flag needed)
# Should give conversational response
```

### 4. Log Shows Actual Training
```bash
grep "Overriding: run" logs/nanochat_speedrun_*.out
# Should show:
#   Overriding: run = my_training_run
# NOT:
#   Overriding: run = dummy
```

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. Default Values Can Be Dangerous
Setting `WANDB_RUN=dummy` as default was convenient for local development but dangerous for automated SLURM jobs.

**Solution:** Fail-fast validation with clear error messages.

### 2. Test Mode Needs Clear Indication
"dummy" mode is useful but should be explicit, not a silent default.

**Solution:** Reject dummy mode explicitly in production scripts.

### 3. Documentation Must Match Configuration
Original docs showed `bash speedrun.sh` which handles defaults interactively. SLURM version needs different approach.

**Solution:** Update all documentation to show required variables explicitly.

### 4. Early Validation Saves Time
Catching configuration errors in < 1 minute is vastly better than discovering them after 12 hours.

**Solution:** Add comprehensive pre-flight checks.
