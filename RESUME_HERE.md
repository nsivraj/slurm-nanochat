# 🚀 Resume Here - Quick Start Guide

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01
**Current State:** All fixes applied, ready for next training run

---

## 📌 TL;DR - What You Need to Know

### The Problem We Fixed
Your previous training runs (Oct 30-31) **partially succeeded** but had a critical issue:
- ✅ Base model trained successfully
- ❌ Midtraining and SFT were **SKIPPED** due to `WANDB_RUN=dummy`
- ❌ Chat functionality doesn't work (no SFT model)

### The Solution
We added **mandatory WANDB_RUN validation** to the SLURM script:
- Job now **fails immediately** if `WANDB_RUN` is not set or equals "dummy"
- Clear error messages tell you exactly what to do
- No wandb account needed - any non-"dummy" name works!

---

## ✅ What's Ready

### All Fixes Applied
1. ✅ **SLURM script** (`scripts/speedrun.slurm`) - Added WANDB_RUN validation
2. ✅ **Documentation** (`PTOLEMY_SETUP.md`) - Updated with requirements
3. ✅ **Quick guide** (`QUICK_RERUN_GUIDE.md`) - Updated commands
4. ✅ **Status tracking** (`PTOLEMY_SESSION_STATUS.md`) - Comprehensive overview
5. ✅ **All data downloaded** - Dataset, tokenizers, eval bundle, etc.

### What You Have
- ✅ Trained base model (from previous runs)
- ✅ All required data pre-downloaded
- ✅ Virtual environment set up
- ✅ Configuration validated and fixed

---

## 🎯 Next Steps - Run This Command

```bash
# SSH to Ptolemy
ssh <username>@ptolemy-login.arc.msstate.edu

# Navigate to project
cd /scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/slurm-nanochat

# Submit job with WANDB_RUN set (CRITICAL!)
WANDB_RUN=ptolemy_run_3 sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
```

**That's it!** The job will:
1. Validate WANDB_RUN is set correctly ✅
2. Train base model (~7 hours)
3. **Actually train midtraining** (~2-3 hours) ← This will work now!
4. **Actually train SFT** (~1-2 hours) ← This will work now!
5. Generate complete report with all metrics

---

## 📊 What to Expect

### Timeline
```
0:00  → Job starts, validation passes ✅
0:05  → Tokenizer eval done ✅
7:00  → Base training done (CORE: ~0.21) ✅
9:30  → Midtraining done ✅ (NEW - will actually train!)
11:30 → SFT done ✅ (NEW - will actually train!)
11:35 → Complete report generated ✅
```

### Cost
- Previous runs: ~$206 (partial success)
- This run: ~$140-170
- **Total investment: ~$346-376** for complete ChatGPT-style model

---

## 🔍 How to Monitor

### Check Job Status
```bash
squeue -u $USER
```

### Watch Progress Live
```bash
# Get your job ID
JOBID=$(squeue -u $USER -h -o %i | head -1)

# Watch output
tail -f /scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/slurm-nanochat/logs/nanochat_speedrun_${JOBID}.out
```

### You'll Get Email Notifications
- **BEGIN** - Job started
- **END** - Job completed ✅
- **FAIL** - Something went wrong ❌

---

## 💬 Workaround: Chat with Base Model Now

While waiting for the full training, you can chat with your base model:

```bash
# Request interactive GPU session
srun --account=class-cse8990 --partition=gpu-a100 --gres=gpu:1 --mem=32G --time=1:00:00 --pty bash

# Setup
cd /scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/slurm-nanochat
source /scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/nanochat-venv/bin/activate
export NANOCHAT_BASE_DIR="/scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/nanochat-cache"

# Chat (note the -i mid flag to use base model)
python -m scripts.chat_cli -i mid -p "Why is the sky blue?"
```

**Once SFT training completes**, you can drop the `-i mid` flag and chat with the much better SFT model!

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

### Must Set WANDB_RUN
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Job will fail immediately
sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm

# ❌ WRONG - Job will fail immediately
WANDB_RUN=dummy sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm

# ✅ CORRECT - Any non-"dummy" name works
WANDB_RUN=my_run sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
WANDB_RUN=ptolemy_training sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
WANDB_RUN=test_run_3 sbatch scripts/speedrun.slurm
```

### No Wandb Account Needed
- You do **NOT** need to create a wandb account
- You do **NOT** need to run `wandb login`
- The name just needs to be non-"dummy"
- System will skip wandb logging but still train everything

## 🎓 Assignment Context

**Course:** CSE8990
**Assignment:** Transformer Architecture Analysis

**What You're Building:**

## 🚦 Quick Checklist

Ready to run when you:
- [ ] SSH to Ptolemy

## 💡 Pro Tips

### While Training Runs
- Training takes 10-12 hours - perfect for overnight
- Check your email for status updates
- Monitor logs occasionally to ensure progress
- Don't worry if you lose connection - job keeps running

### After Training Completes
```bash
# Download the report to review locally
scp <username>@ptolemy-login.arc.msstate.edu:/scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/slurm-nanochat/report.md .

# Download the logs
scp <username>@ptolemy-login.arc.msstate.edu:/scratch/ptolemy/users/$USER/slurm-nanochat/logs/nanochat_speedrun_*.out logs/
```

### If Something Goes Wrong
1. Check the error log: `tail logs/nanochat_speedrun_*.err`
2. Review `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
3. Check `PTOLEMY_SESSION_STATUS.md` for known issues

## 📞 Quick Help

### Job Failed?
Check the error message:
- "WANDB_RUN not set" → Set WANDB_RUN when submitting
- "WANDB_RUN is dummy" → Use a different name
- "Data not found" → Run `scripts/download_data.sh` first
- "Time limit" → Job hit 12-hour max, partial success is OK

### Chat Not Working?
```bash
# Error: FileNotFoundError: chatsft_checkpoints
# Solution: Use base model instead
python -m scripts.chat_cli -i mid

# Or re-run training with correct WANDB_RUN
```
